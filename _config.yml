  The Fellowship of the Ring was formed as a brotherhood among members of the various Free People of Middle-earth.
  Its purpose was to take the One Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom, the mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed, this would ultimately kill Dark Lord Sauron.
